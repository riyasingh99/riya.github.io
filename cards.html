        <h3>How Deryl McKissack, president and CEO of design and construction management firm McKissack & McKissack, is reimagining public and private spaces for the postâ€“COVID-19 world.</h3>
        <p>Deryl McKissack, the president and CEO of McKissack & McKissack, a design and construction services group, has had a unique journey in the industry. Her family has a long history in architecture and construction, dating back to the 18th century when her great-great-grandfather came to America as a slave and became a builder. Inspired by her family's legacy, McKissack founded her own firm in the late 1990s.<br>

            McKissack's purpose as a leader is to improve lives through building and design. She realized this during a visit to a high school restroom in Washington, DC, where she noticed the deteriorated state of the facilities and considered the impact it could have on the students' self-confidence. This realization led her to expand the company's mission beyond bricks and mortar and focus on enhancing lives through design and construction.<br>
            
            McKissack & McKissack has become a leading firm in the industry, with offices in several cities across the United States and a portfolio of landmark projects, including the George H.W. Bush Library, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The firm has been able to adapt to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued to do steady business as organizations rethink buildings and infrastructure for the post-pandemic world.
            
            McKissack believes that the pandemic will have a lasting impact on the design world. It will influence the way public spaces are designed, with a focus on spacing and touchless features. The workplace will also undergo changes, with better HVAC systems, increased personal space, and more touchless technology. McKissack expects that remote work will continue in some capacity even after the pandemic, leading to a hybrid approach to doing business.<br>
            
            The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of sustainability in the industry. McKissack's firm has always prioritized sustainable building practices, and they continue to look for ways to improve in this area. The lockdowns and remote work have inadvertently led to cleaner air and lower emissions, highlighting the positive impact of sustainable practices.
            
            Overall, McKissack remains optimistic about the future of her firm and the industry. She believes that the need for construction and design services will remain strong, and there will be opportunities in both the public and private sectors. The pandemic has accelerated certain trends, such as the transformation of commercial real estate and the adoption of technology in the industry, which McKissack sees as positive developments.<br>

        <h3>Biotech Success Stories: Starting on a Shoestring Budget</h3>
        <p>Introduction:
            Starting a biotech company can be a daunting task due to the high capital requirements involved. However, several successful biotech companies have managed to overcome this challenge and achieve remarkable success with minimal funding or even no funding at all. In this blog post, we will explore three inspiring case studies of biotech companies that thrived despite their limited financial resources. These stories highlight innovative approaches to demonstrate technical feasibility, target smaller markets initially, and generate upfront revenue through service offerings. By examining these examples, we can gain valuable insights into starting a biotech venture on a shoestring budget.<br>
            
            GeneWEAVE: Scrappiness and Focus Lead to Success
            GeneWEAVE, currently a division of Roche, has become a leading provider of in vitro diagnostics in the biotech industry. They utilize a unique approach to infectious disease diagnostics by using phages (viruses that infect bacteria) as the detection mechanism, offering faster and more cost-effective results compared to traditional PCR-based techniques. However, GeneWEAVE's journey began with limited resources. Co-founder and CTO, Diego Rey, was determined to prove the technical feasibility of their phage-based diagnostics.
            With a focus on demonstrating the viability of their idea, the GeneWEAVE team secured $75,000 in grant money and hired a postdoc at Cornell University to conduct the initial proof-of-principle study. Although the study showed promising results using lab strains of bacteria, it was crucial to validate the technology with bacteria recovered from actual infections, such as drug-resistant staph (MRSA).
            
            To raise additional funds and progress further, GeneWEAVE set up a chain of experiments, using each successful milestone as leverage for securing more funding. Their initial investor check of $150,000 enabled them to generate more data and convince another investor to contribute an equal amount. This pattern continued, leading to subsequent rounds of funding, totaling $12 million in Series A investments. By demonstrating the technology's effectiveness with real-world bacterial specimens, GeneWEAVE successfully attracted investors and laid the foundation for their remarkable growth.<br>
            
            Key takeaways from GeneWEAVE's journey:<br>
            
            Focus intensely on proving technical feasibility.
            Secure small rounds of funding through incremental milestones.
            Use initial data to convince investors and raise subsequent rounds.
            BillionToOne: Repurposing Technology for Initial Market Entry
            BillionToOne, a biotech company specializing in diagnostic blood tests, has raised over $30 million and is currently developing a blood test for detecting cancer. Their innovative approach involves utilizing cell-free DNA, which is released into the bloodstream when cells die, allowing for early detection of cancer mutations. However, when starting out, BillionToOne decided to target a different market segment to facilitate initial market entry.
            Instead of pursuing cancer diagnostics as their primary product, BillionToOne repurposed their core cell-free DNA technology for non-invasive prenatal screening. This decision was driven by the fact that prenatal screening already had established reimbursement rules, making it easier to enter the market. In prenatal testing, fetal DNA released from placental cells into the mother's bloodstream provides valuable information about the fetus's health and potential genetic disorders.
            
            By focusing on prenatal screening, BillionToOne could leverage existing care patterns and insurance reimbursements, streamlining their path to revenue generation. They collaborated with physicians and scientists interested in sickle cell prenatal diagnosis and conducted a clinical study to develop their laboratory-developed test (LDT). The enthusiastic support from these stakeholders allowed them to complete their product development and clinical studies for approximately $2 million before raising $15 million in Series A funding.<br>
            
            Key takeaways from BillionToOne's journey:
            
            Repurpose technology for initial market entry in a more accessible segment.
            Align with established care patterns and reimbursement rules.
            Collaborate with passionate researchers and physicians to conduct<br>
